# L-System Generator

This repository contains code for generating L-system strings based on provided axiom and rules. L-systems are used to model naturally occurring patterns in nature such as growth of trees, growth of multicellular organisms, fractals, etc., by recursively applying a set of simple grammar rules over a set of variables starting with an Axiom.

## Usage

To use the L-system generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
  
3. Navigate to the repository directory:

4. Open `index.js` file and provide your axiom and rules.

5. Run the code using Node.js:
   
6. Check the console output for the generated L-system string.

## Example Output

Here is an example output generated by the L-system generator for the Cantor fractal (n=3):
